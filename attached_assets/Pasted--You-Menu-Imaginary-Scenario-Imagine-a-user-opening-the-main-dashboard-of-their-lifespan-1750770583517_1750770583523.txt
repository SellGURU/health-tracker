This ia an article and below it its text:

All of us agree on some things-for example, that cars should be regularly checked and maintained.
However, the importance of regular medical checkups is sometimes questioned. Everyone knows that replacing a spare part on a car or buying a new vehicle is just a question of finances while replacing a malfunctioning bodily organ is a very complex task, and replacing your physical body for a new one is merely a science fiction concept.
When developing a health checkup program, the experts of the Scientific and Medical Department of Ornament have applied the principles of evidence-based medicine, using the research of leading international medical centers and hospitals and recommendations of the World Health Organization.
Factors considered during a proper medical checkup
Age
During the first year of life, we need medical examinations monthly. This is because it is difficult for humans to adapt to new living conditions, which are very different from the intrauterine conditions of the fetus.
An additional challenge is the immaturity of bodily organs and systems early in life. If a disorder develops, the baby obviously cannot evaluate his or her state and describe it. As the baby becomes older, the frequency of regular checkups decreases compared to infancy.
Young and middle-aged individuals without chronic illnesses who are not subjected to occupational hazards and are not living in extreme conditions can have a preventive checkup once per year.
Seniors need a more careful approach, which calls for more frequent preventive checkups. This is attributed to age-related changes and chronic illnesses.
Gender
The scope of medical consultations, tests, and research is different for men and women. This is natural as gender requires different health approaches.
Their endocrine systems function differently, reactions to stress vary, and age-related changes are also expressed differently.
Special Circumstances
One of the examples of circumstances that dictate a unique preventive approach is pregnancy in women. For this reason, future mothers should follow special medical checkup programs that address the needs of the mother and the baby.
The presence of chronic conditions in the phase of stable remission calls for an expanded checkup and regular consultations of medical experts. Some conditions require special tests and research.
For example, in case of heart disorders, it is necessary to visit a cardiologist, do EKG and/or echocardiogram, monitor the level of various cholesterol fractions, and measure the thickness of the internal layer of blood vessels most affected by atherosclerosis.
In chronic liver disease, special attention should be paid to the biochemical blood test and ultrasound examination. Some disorders call for daily monitoring - for example, diabetes.
Family History of Diseases
When developing a medical checkup program, experts account for the family history of diseases and risks of developing hereditary pathology. In most countries, newborn babies have neonatal screening, which includes examination for most widespread hereditary disorders such as phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, galactosemia, adrenogenital syndrome, cystic fibrosis, etc.
All of these present a serious threat to children's health, especially in the absence of timely treatment. Keep in mind that this examination doesn't include all hereditary disorders. For this reason, the doctor should know the history of disorders in your family. It can help medical professionals run a timely test to identify a disease at its earliest stage, spot minimal manifestations of progressing pathology and provide timely recommendations to prevent developing medical conditions.
Bad Habits
Bad habits negatively influence the human body in one way or another. Therefore, in the presence of bad habits, a checkup program should include physical tests that would help detect developing pathology.
For example, in the case of excessive alcohol consumption, it is important to pay special attention to the state of the liver and the central nervous system, while smoking may affect soft parts of the face and respiratory organs.
Unbalanced diet and irregular eating habits, tendency to overeat, excess weight, excessive consumption of sweet or fatty foods, and frequent consumption of processed products for special attention to the state of the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine, and cardiovascular system as well as for more frequent monitoring of the level of cholesterol, level of other hormones, and blood glucose level.
Physical activity is essential for keeping good health. It is important to bear in mind that professional sports and overly intense physical activity can overstrain the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems.
Having comprehensive information about occupational hazards, climate conditions, eating and living habits, physical activity, and travel history can help a medical professional create a specific checkup program for each patient.

When we open this page:
Baby
3 week
Weight
< 0.1 g
Size
< 1 mm
Conception has just taken place, and a human being has started to develop from two tiny cells. By the end of the first week, the weight of the embryo is under one gram, and its length is under a millimeter.
What is going on
On days 5-6 after fertilization, the blastocyst attaches to the endometrium. The blastocyst is dozens or hundreds of cells from which your child will develop. It looks like a small bubble. Two days after the attachment, the blastocyst is completely embedded in the uterine mucosa.
The implantation may take place only on days 19-22 of the menstrual cycle, as in this period the uterine mucosa (the endometrium) is most receptive and ready to accept the blastocyst.
Terms and periods
The first trimester of pregnancy is called "the period of blastogenesis, organogenesis, and placentation". It starts when an egg is fertilized and a zygote is formed and lasts for 12 weeks. The first trimester also includes the start of the early fetal period.

Mom:
"Your appearance hasn't changed"
Notes early unawareness of pregnancy
When we open this page:
Mom
3 week
This is the first week of pregnancy after conception. You are likely to be unaware of your pregnancy.
The size and weight of the embryo are so small that it is too early to speak about any weight gain.
Pregnancy tests may not show anything either — they are based on the detection of the hormone beta-HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in urine. This hormone starts to produce only after the embryo is implanted - normally, 6 to 8 days after conception.
What to expect
Moderate bloody discharge. The discharge should last no longer than two days, with no unpleasant odors. The color may vary from pink to brown. Nagging lower abdominal pains. If you are generally sensitive, you may experience a dull pain above the pubis or in the small of the back. Increased basal, or resting, temperature. During this period, it may reach 98.6º-99.1 °F, quickly going back to normal.
Don't be alarmed — this is not associated with any sickness.
How to take your basal temperature
Basal temperature is taken in the rectum. It should be done immediately after you wake up from a sleep lasting longer than 3 hours, at rest, before you leave the bed.
What to do
At this stage of the pregnancy, begin to be more careful about yourself and your health. It's essential to stop smoking and avoid stress and complications of chronic diseases. Any increased risk factors and health issues may affect the well-being of your future children.
If you suspect you might be pregnant (you had unprotected sex during the third week of your cycle), take extra care of your health, nutrition, and lifestyle. Pay attention to household chemicals you use, the temperature in rooms, and workplace conditions - all of these are important for your well-being.
Food
Most specific food recommendations cannot be given yet. Do not consume alcohol and do not take certain medications.
Which medicines may be dangerous:
﻿﻿Antiviral products
﻿﻿Some antibiotics (streptomycin, tetracycline)
﻿﻿Hypotensive drugs (reserpine, hydrochlorothiazide)
﻿﻿Antidepressants
﻿﻿Immunosuppressive agents
﻿﻿Hormonal medicines
﻿﻿Vitamin A in doses over 10,000 IU/day
If you have any chronic medical conditions, talk with your doctor to get prepared for pregnancy. They may help you reduce the number of medications you take or help you to stop taking them completely.
Physical activity
Watch your cycle and avoid heavy lifts and intensive workouts during its second half. Excessive physical activity may prevent the embryo from implanting in the uterus.
Sexual activity
An active sexual life (daily contacts, multiple partners) may interfere with your pregnancy, even at an early stage. It's important to make sure neither you nor your partner has any infectious diseases, as they may lead to miscarriages or congenital defects.
Your partner and other friends and family
During pregnancy your body will change; you will develop new needs and won't be able to do some things you normally could. It's helpful to have friends and family around you who can offer support, especially your partner. Think about who you can rely on and in what situations you may call on them.

What to Eat When You're Expecting?
Proper nutrition during pregnancy is the key to the well-being of both the mother and the unborn baby. Even if you have never been a fan of a healthy lifestyle, getting pregnant should change your perspective. Proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle will significantly increase your chances of a problem-free pregnancy, ensure a quick physical recovery, and, most importantly, ensure the birth of a healthy child.
EXPERT
Dr. Helene
obstetrician-gynecologist
What foods should you eat?
Green and yellow vegetables and fruits, especially broccoli. Broccoli contains Folic acid, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium,zinc, beta Carotene, selenium, vitamins PP, K, E-this low-calorie vegetable is a storehouse of useful nutrients. If you don't like broccoli, eat more greens, spinach, and other green and yellow vegetables. For fruit, eat green apples.
Eggs contain folic acid as well as selenium, choline, biotin, easily digestible proteins, and amino acids, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. Eggs are rich in vitamins A, E, D, B12, and B3.
Fermented milk products, such as yogurt and kefir, contribute to harmonious digestion and favorable microflora in the stomach and intestines. Expectant mothers should include a variety of low-fat types of cheese and cottage cheese in their diet, as they contain a lot of calcium and phosphorus.
Fish is not as "heavy" as meat, and it is better absorbed. Low-fat varieties of fish that are ideal for expecting mothers include cod and sea bass. They contain minerals, proteins, and Omega-3 fatty acids, which are necessary for the healthy development of the baby.
Meats such as rabbit, turkey, and veal are useful during pregnancy as they are rich in protein and contain little fat.
Whole grains and cereals such as wild rice, whole wheat bread, oatmeal, wheat germ, bran, and buckwheat are extremely important for digestion as they contain a lot of vegetable fiber and complex carbohydrates as well as calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and B vitamins.
Butter, which contains fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin A has regenerative properties and is important for sight as well as fetal growth.
Vitamin D regulates the processes of cell division, promotes the absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the body (which is especially necessary during pregnancy), and participates in the synthesis of several hormones. Vitamin K affects metabolism and blood clotting, and Vitamin E is a versatile protector of cell membranes against oxidative damage.
How much should you eat and how do you combine nutrients?
Pregnant women are advised to eat often but in small portions. Be sure to supplement your diet with vitamins, as it is almost impossible to get your entire supply of vitamins and nutrients necessary for you and your baby solely from food. Getting all of these nutrients from food would require non-stop eating.
Additionally, it is important to keep in mind how different nutrients combine and affect one another:
﻿﻿Vitamins A and D neutralize each other
﻿﻿Vitamins E and D must be taken separately since the first component is poorly absorbed under the influence of the second.
﻿﻿Riboflavin and (cyanocobalamin) B12 cannot be absorbed together
﻿﻿The combination B6 + B12 is ineffective since when they are combined, both components are destroyed
﻿﻿Cyanocobalamin (B12) and thiamin, B1) can cause allergic reactions
﻿﻿Iron absorption is impaired by zinc, calcium, and chromium intake
There are many such examples, but memorizing them all is not necessary. Ornament's maternity regimen has a list of the most important vitamins with detailed recommendations regarding intake.
What nutrients to combine, what foods and drinks contain certain nutrients, and what signs indicate a deficiency of a particular vitamin in the body-all of this information will be at your fingertips.

About section:
A person's growth depends largely on external and internal factors. Internal factors are influenced by heredity, age, gender, hormonal regulation of growth, the presence of chronic diseases, and race. External factors include nutrition, physical activity, and environmental conditions. A growth disorder is considered to be a significant deviation of body length from the age-specific rate in a particular population.

About section: 
             Ornament Wiki button
Body mass (weight) is an important indicator of health. Low body mass, or being underweight, leads to the depletion of muscle mass (sarcopenia), proteins, fat-soluble vitamins, and fats. It also leads to hormonal disorders. High body mass, or being overweight, leads to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal diseases, and an increased risk of some cancers.

Acidosis
Header: Acidosis
Text: Acidosis is used to describe the process of the buildup of acid in blood or tissue. Degrees of acidity or alkalinity are commonly expressed using the pH scale. On this scale, lower numbers represent acidity, while higher numbers identify alkalinity.
Human blood is a slightly alkaline fluid, with a normal pH between 7.35-7.45 (the pH of pure water is exactly 7). When the pH of blood drops below 7.35, becoming more acidic, the person is said to have acidemia.
Symptoms
Symptoms of acidosis depend on the degree of change in acidity and include:
﻿﻿Nausea
﻿﻿Vomiting
﻿﻿Headaches
﻿﻿Rowsiness
In severe cases, the heart may not be able to function normally, causing shock, coma, or even death.
Doctors diagnose acidosis by taking blood tests to determine the blood pH as well as the concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases in the patient's blood.
Possible Causes
Physicians commonly classify acidosis as being one of two types-metabolic or respiratory. This distinction is important because it describes the root cause of the condition.
The causes for metabolic acidosis include consuming acids or substances that can be converted to acid such as methanol, antifreeze, large amounts of aspirin, etc. It can also be caused by diabetes or kidney failure, as these cause acid to build up within the body.
Respiratory acidosis is caused by diseases affecting the lungs or nervous system. If a person cannot breathe normally due to chronic obstructive disease, asthma, pneumonia, or muscle weakness caused by diseases of the nervous system, they will develop respiratory acidosis.
Treatment
Treatment of acidosis depends on the cause and may include using antidotes for toxic substances or controlling a patient's diabetes with insulin. A physician will try to fix the cause of the acidosis while giving the patient intravenous fluids and bicarbonate, an alkaline substance, to counteract the acids.
The course and outcome of acidosis depends on how severe the condition causing the acidosis is, as well as if it reacts to treatment.

Insidetracker

1. How the Action Plan Works
Data-Driven Creation:
 After users receive their blood test and/or DNA results, InsideTracker’s app automatically generates a highly personalized Action Plan based on multiple inputs:
Biomarkers that are outside optimized ranges (for example, high LDL cholesterol, low vitamin D levels, or elevated cortisol). InsideTracker’s Action Plan is your personalized list of recommendations, designed to make the biggest impact on helping you achieve your wellness goal and optimize your biomarkers. Once your results have been posted to your account, you can log in and select a wellness goal to generate your action plan.

User health goals specified during onboarding or updated later (such as “Improve energy,” “Reduce inflammation,” “Lose weight,” or “Boost athletic performance”).

Lifestyle data gathered from connected apps and devices like Apple Health, Fitbit, or Garmin, including activity levels and sleep patterns.



Components of the Action Plan:
Nutrition: Specific food recommendations tailored to your needs, such as “Increase leafy greens for better folate levels” or “Avoid processed meats to reduce inflammation.

Supplements: Personalized supplement suggestions with exact dosages, e.g., “Take 2,000 IU vitamin D daily.”



Exercise: Targeted workout recommendations like “Perform HIIT workouts to lower fasting glucose.”

Lifestyle: Guidance on improving sleep hygiene, stress management techniques, and other habits to support overall wellness.

Dynamic Updates:
 The Action Plan is not static — it adjusts dynamically if you retest your biomarkers, update your goals, or change your lifestyle inputs, ensuring recommendations stay relevant and effective.

2. How Each Program is Assigned to Users
 Initial Data Collection & Onboarding
When a user first signs up for InsideTracker, they provide key information including:


Blood test results (either from an InsideTracker test kit or imported lab results).


Optional DNA data, if the user chooses to add genetic insights.


Lifestyle inputs such as diet, activity level, sleep habits, and personal health goals.


Users explicitly select or prioritize health goals during onboarding, for example:


“Improve energy levels”


“Reduce inflammation”


“Support heart health”


“Boost athletic performance”


“Live longer”

 Biomarker Prioritization by Algorithm
InsideTracker’s platform analyzes the user’s biomarker data against scientifically validated optimal ranges.


The system identifies which biomarkers are outside their optimized range, either too high or too low (e.g., elevated LDL cholesterol, low vitamin D, high cortisol, etc.).


Based on these biomarker deviations, the platform determines priority health concerns. For example:
If cortisol is elevated, the system flags stress and may recommend a Stress Reduction Program.


If inflammation markers are high, an Anti-Inflammation Program may be triggered.


If vitamin or mineral deficiencies are detected, a Nutrient Optimization Program is assigned.
The algorithm weighs both the severity of biomarker deviations and their relevance to user goals to tailor program assignments.

Integration of User-Selected Goals
User goals strongly influence which programs are assigned. For instance:


Someone focused on longevity may receive programs aimed at reducing inflammation, improving metabolic health, and supporting cardiovascular function.


An athlete wanting performance boosts may be assigned programs emphasizing muscle recovery, energy metabolism, and hydration.


These goals help prioritize certain biomarker corrections over others, shaping the program content.


Scientific Evidence and Research-Backed Matching
Each program inside InsideTracker is built around the latest scientific evidence linking biomarkers, nutrition, supplements, and lifestyle interventions.


The system cross-references:


Biomarker status


Genetic predispositions (if DNA data is available)


User preferences and lifestyle inputs


To select the most effective and personalized programs for each user.
Automatic and Dynamic Program Assignment
Based on the above factors, the app automatically assigns one or more programs tailored to your unique biology and goals.


Programs are modular and can cover topics such as:


Heart health


Stress management


Inflammation reduction


Weight management


Muscle recovery


Sleep improvement


As new test results arrive or goals change, the system can update or add new programs dynamically to keep recommendations current.

Manual User Control and Flexibility
Users can browse the full library of available programs within the app.


They have the option to add or remove programs manually, providing flexibility beyond the automatic assignments. For example, a user might add a “Gut Health Program” even if their initial biomarkers did not trigger it.


This empowers users to explore specific health interests or concerns proactively.

3. How Users Check Their Assigned Tasks
Dedicated “Action Plan” Dashboard
Once programs are assigned, users access their tasks through a clearly defined “Action Plan” tab or section in the app.
This dashboard presents all personalized tasks and recommendations in one place, making it easy to understand what actions to take daily or weekly.

Prioritized and Categorized Task Lists
Data-Driven Prioritization
Tasks are not listed randomly or equally; they are carefully prioritized based on:
Which biomarkers are most out-of-range or pose the greatest health risk.
The user’s personal goals (e.g., a user focused on reducing inflammation will see inflammation-related tasks prioritized).
The potential impact of each task on improving biomarker levels efficiently.
This means users see the most important, high-impact actions first, ensuring they focus on what matters most.
Categorization by Health Domain
Tasks are grouped into intuitive categories such as:
Nutrition: Specific foods to eat or avoid.
Supplements: Dosage and timing recommendations.
Exercise: Targeted workouts or movement goals.
Lifestyle: Sleep, stress management, hydration, and other wellness habits.


This clear separation helps users focus their attention and organize their daily routines better.
Dynamic Task Adjustment Within Categories
InsideTracker’s system dynamically adjusts task priority and categorization as users retest biomarkers or update goals.
For example, if a vitamin deficiency resolves, nutrition tasks related to that vitamin may be de-prioritized or removed.
This keeps the list relevant and avoids overwhelming users with outdated recommendations.
Progress Tracking Within Categories
Each category often has its own progress indicators or completion percentages, so users can see which health domains they are excelling in and which need more focus.
This granular feedback helps users balance their efforts across nutrition, exercise, supplements, and lifestyle.
Task Complexity Gradation
Tasks within categories can range from simple micro-actions (e.g., “Drink one extra glass of water”) to more involved habits (e.g., “Complete a 30-minute strength training session”).
This gradation helps users gradually build healthy habits without feeling overwhelmed.
Visual Progress Indicators
The app includes progress bars or completion percentages for each goal or biomarker, giving users visual feedback on how close they are to achieving optimal levels (e.g., “Vitamin D: 40% to target”).
This helps users stay motivated by tracking their ongoing improvement.


Task Details and Educational Content
Each task usually has a brief explanation or rationale attached, educating the user on why this action is important and how it influences their health markers.
This fosters a better understanding and encourages adherence.
Notifications and Reminders
The app sends push notifications or in-app reminders for tasks that are time-sensitive or daily, such as:


“Take your magnesium supplement tonight.”
“Log today’s workout.”


These reminders help users stay consistent and avoid missing important steps.

4. How Users Mark Tasks as Done
. Manual Task Completion Logging
For most tasks — including nutrition, exercise, supplements, and lifestyle habits — users can manually mark them as completed by tapping a “✔️ Log Completed” button or checkbox next to each task within the Action Plan section.


Examples:


“Ate spinach today” → Tap the checkmark to confirm.
“Completed 30 minutes of cardio” → Mark as done after finishing the workout.
“Took vitamin D supplement” → Check off the daily supplement.

About the “Log Completed”
Task-Level Granularity:


The “Log Completed” button is typically available on a per-task basis—meaning each individual recommendation (like “Eat spinach today” or “Take magnesium supplement”) has its own separate log action.
This lets users track exactly which tasks they completed rather than marking a whole category done at once.


Immediate Visual Confirmation:


Once tapped, the task immediately changes visually (usually turning green with a checkmark), giving clear instant feedback that the action has been recorded.
This quick feedback loop helps reinforce positive behavior.


Daily Reset / Recurrence:


Many tasks are designed to be daily or periodic. The “Log Completed” state resets after each cycle (daily, weekly, etc.), allowing users to log the same task repeatedly over time.
For example, a daily vitamin supplement can be logged every day to track consistent adherence.


Impact on Progress Tracking:


Each logged completion contributes to real-time updates of progress bars and goal completion percentages.
This linkage between logging and progress visualization keeps motivation high.


Optional Notes or Details:


In some versions or depending on the task type, the app may allow users to add optional notes when logging completion—for instance, entering how much spinach they ate or how long their workout lasted.


Sync with Health Data (When Available):


For certain activities (like exercise), if the user has connected wearable devices or health apps, the app can auto-log task completion without manual tapping, reducing friction.


Reminders Linked to Logging:


The “Log Completed” action is often tied to reminder notifications, so when users receive a reminder (“Take your vitamin D now”), they can immediately open the app and tap “Log Completed” to confirm.
Automatic Syncing with Connected Devices
When users connect the app to fitness trackers or health apps such as Apple Health, Fitbit, or Garmin:


Certain exercise tasks can be automatically logged based on synced workout or activity data.
For example, completing a logged run or a strength session in your wearable app can reflect as task completion in InsideTracker without manual input.


Visual Feedback and Progress Updates
Completed tasks visually change — usually turning green with a checkmark — to give immediate confirmation of progress.
The app’s progress bars and completion percentages update in real-time to reflect the user’s adherence.
This visual reinforcement helps users stay motivated by showing tangible progress towards their health goals.

5. Who Checks the Action Plans Before the Client Receives Them?
Automated Algorithmic Generation and Review
Data Input: When a user uploads their blood test results, DNA data, and lifestyle info, InsideTracker’s backend system immediately begins processing this data.
Algorithm Role: The platform uses complex, proprietary algorithms built from thousands of scientific studies and clinical guidelines. These algorithms:


Identify which biomarkers are out of optimized ranges.
Match these biomarkers to evidence-based interventions (nutrition, supplements, exercise, lifestyle).
Weigh user goals and lifestyle factors to prioritize recommendations.


Speed and Consistency: This automated generation allows for near-instant personalized plan creation without human delay, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across all users.
Quality Assurance: The algorithm includes numerous built-in validations and safety checks to prevent recommending unsafe dosages or conflicting advice.

2. Scientific Oversight by Experts 
Team Composition: InsideTracker employs a multidisciplinary team including:


Clinical scientists with backgrounds in biochemistry, nutrition, and medicine.
Registered dietitians and nutrition experts.
Data scientists and software engineers who maintain and update the algorithms.


Algorithm Development: These experts design the algorithms and continuously update them based on:


New scientific publications.
Emerging clinical guidelines.
User feedback and real-world data.


Validation Process: Before deployment, algorithm updates undergo rigorous internal validation including:


Cross-checking recommendations against current clinical best practices.
Testing on historical datasets to verify accuracy and safety.


Ongoing Monitoring: The expert team monitors aggregate user outcomes and system performance to identify potential issues and improve recommendations over time.

3. No Individual Manual Review per Client 
Scale Consideration: InsideTracker serves thousands (or more) of users, making manual review of each individual’s Action Plan impractical and inefficient.
Reliance on Automation: To deliver timely results, the system trusts its algorithmic engine and expert oversight rather than human review for each user.
Exceptions: Only in rare cases, such as flagged results indicating serious health risks, might the system trigger alerts for human review or recommend users seek medical advice.
User Responsibility: Users are encouraged to share their results and plans with their personal healthcare providers for further interpretation if needed.

4. Optional Professional Consultations 
InsideTracker Coaching Services:


Some subscription tiers or add-on services offer access to health coaches, nutritionists, or clinical experts who review your results and Action Plan.
These professionals can tailor advice further based on your full health history, preferences, or special conditions.


Third-Party Consultation:


Users can also independently share their InsideTracker reports with their own doctors or dietitians for expert review.


Benefits of Consultation:


Personalized interpretation beyond algorithmic recommendations.
Adjustment of plans considering medications, allergies, or lifestyle constraints.
Accountability and motivation through coaching support.
