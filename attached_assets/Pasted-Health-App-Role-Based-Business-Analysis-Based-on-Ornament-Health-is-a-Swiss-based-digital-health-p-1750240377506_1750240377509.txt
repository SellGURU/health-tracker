Schematic Overview of Backend Interactions User Interaction: Users (patients, professionals, or clinic-invited patients) interact via the frontend (mobile/web app). Authentication: Frontend sends OAuth 2.0 token to API gateway for user verification. API Request: Frontend calls endpoints (e.g., /lab-results/upload, /holistic-plans/create) with JSON payloads. Processing: API gateway routes requests to backend services (e.g., lab parsing, AI analysis, doctor or clinic professional validation queue). Data Storage: Data stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with encrypted fields for sensitive information. External Integration: Apple Health or lab APIs feed data via secure channels. Response: Backend returns JSON data (e.g., health profile, holistic plan, action plan) to frontend for display. Real-Time Updates: WebSocket connections push alerts (e.g., abnormal results, challenge progress, or holistic plan updates). B2B Workflow: Partners use /b2b/integrate to sync data, with branded apps leveraging the same endpoints. Analytics: Administrators access usage metrics via internal API endpoints. Clinic-Initiated Workflow: For clinic-invited patients, healthcare professionals from the inviting clinic can access, generate, or validate holistic plans and action plans directly, bypassing additional validation fees. Suggested Data Model The pseudo data model supports all app features, including holistic plan generation and clinic-invited workflows, ensuring scalability and relational integrity. Entities are defined with attributes and relationships, stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

Indexes on user_id, date for fast queries on historical data and holistic plans. Challenges and Recommendations Challenges: Subscription Transparency: Unexpected charges (e.g., $63 renewals after $20 promotions) and unclear terms for holistic plan validations. Limited Apple Health Sync: No blood pressure or weight pulling, impacting holistic plan accuracy. Support Delays: Response times (~1 hour) frustrate users, especially for clinic-invited workflows. Language Barriers: Some content (e.g., holistic plan articles) English-only. Refund Issues: Strict policies for premium features like holistic plans cause dissatisfaction. Doctor Validation Pricing: Tentative pricing ($15-$25 for holistic plans, $10-$20 for action plans/reports) may confuse users. UI Intuitiveness: Subscription prompts post-data entry and complex holistic plan navigation. Recommendations: Disclose subscription terms, patient limits, and validation fees (AI vs. doctor vs. clinic professional) at signup. Plan Apple Health enhancements for Q1 2026 to support holistic plan data integration. Improve support with faster, multilingual responses, prioritizing clinic-invited patients. Simplify refunds with clearer criteria for premium features like holistic plans. Ensure full feature support for all gender options in holistic and action plans. Finalize validation pricing ($15-$25 for holistic plans, $10-$20 for action plans/reports) for transparency.
