1 — Goal / Summary

Make the current You screen the app’s Home (no other changes to existing Monitor menu). Hide Settings from primary nav. The Home/You screen must show high-value health signals (biological age, chronological age) and prompt users to complete missing profile data. Introduce subscription plans inside Health Profile, replace “Add Data” with a dual Chat (Coach + Copilot), rename “Generate Plan” to Request Deep Analysis, and create an Action Plan feature that displays daily tasks with interactive progress (UI should match the screenshot description). Add booking, reminders, invoice download, and an Educational tab.

Home (You) — app opens here.

Monitor — unchanged; remains immediately after Home and must keep current behavior/UI.
